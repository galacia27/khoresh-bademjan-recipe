<h2>Instructions:</h2>

    <ol type="a"> <!-- Lowercase letters -->
        <li>Wash and cut eggplants lengthwise, into thick strips. Dice roma tomatoes, onions, and garlic cloves. Place eggplants in a separate bowl and sprinkle a generous amount of kosher salt on top. Place other ingredients to the side.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li>Turn on stove to medium-high heat. Place skillet on stove and drizzle with olive oil.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li>Once eggplants have soaked in the salt for 15-30 minutes, rinse and pat dry.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li>Once the pan is hot, place eggplants face down on the hot oil. Fry them until they blister, caramelize, and have charred edges. You can cook in multiple rounds, so the eggplants do not overcrowd the pan.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li>Once the eggplants are cooked through, set them aside in a separate bowl or plate. Now, saute the onions and garlic on a low-medium heat, with a splash of olive oil. Make sure to season them, by adding a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li>A few minutes later, or until the onions and garlic break down, add the tomato paste and fresh tomatoes.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li>After 5 minutes, add the can of tomatoes. Also, at this step, add the cumin, turmeric, and cinnamon.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li>After 10 minutes, add the can of chickpeas. Make sure to drain them before adding them to the pan.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li>Add a cup, or less, of water. It should be a stew-like consistency and not be too watery.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li>Simmer the stew, with a lid on, for another 20-30 minutes, so that all the flavours can meld together.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li>Now, add the saffron water, if you have this ingredient, and added the tbsp of lime juice.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li>Taste the stew and see if it requires more salt, pepper, or other seasonings.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li>For serving, add the charred eggplant on top of the chickpea and tomato stew. Serve with plain basmati rice, saffron rice, or bread.</li>
    </ol>&nbsp;

<h2>Tips:</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>Soaking the eggplants in salt draws out moisture from them and prevents them from getting soggy when cooking. This also works great for grilling eggplants or using other methods to cook them.</li>&nbsp;
        <li>Do not overcrowd the pan when cooking the eggplants. Otherwise, it will take a longer time to thoroughly cook all the eggplants, at an even temperature.</li>&nbsp;
        <li>While this recipe is vegetarian, you have the option to add meat, such as beef, veal, goat, chicken, etc.</li>&nbsp;
        <li>There are many variations of eggplant, such as the Chinese, Indian, US, and Italian varieties, so with the different shapes, consider how much eggplant you will need for this dish.</li>&nbsp;
        <li>Using different forms of tomatoes, such as the tomato paste, fresh tomatoes, or canned tomatoes, adds complexity to the dish, as a whole.</li>&nbsp;
        <li>Dried limes can be found from Persian stores, but since it can be difficult to find, fresh lime juice is a great alternative.</li>&nbsp;
        <li>Refrigerate the stew for up to 4-5 days, or freeze it for up to 2 months. Reheat in the microwave or on a stove top, adding water as needed.</li>&nbsp;
        <li>This is a good meal prep idea, for those who are always on the go.</li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
