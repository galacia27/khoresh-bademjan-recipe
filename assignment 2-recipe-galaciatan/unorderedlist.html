    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>Soaking the eggplants in salt draws out moisture from them and prevents them from getting soggy when cooking. This also works great for grilling eggplants or using other methods to cook them.</li>&nbsp;
       <li>Do not overcrowd the pan when cooking the eggplants. Otherwise, it will take a longer time to thoroughly cook all the eggplants, at an even temperature.</li>&nbsp;
       <li>While this recipe is vegetarian, you have the option to add meat, such as beef, veal, goat, chicken, etc.</li>&nbsp;
       <li>There are many variations of eggplant, such as the Chinese, Indian, US, and Italian varieties, so with the different shapes, consider how much eggplant you will need for this dish.</li>&nbsp;
       <li>Using different forms of tomatoes, such as the tomato paste, fresh tomatoes, or canned tomatoes, adds complexity to the dish, as a whole.</li>&nbsp;
       <li>Dried limes can be found from Persian stores, but since it can be difficult to find, fresh lime juice is a great alternative.</li>&nbsp;
       <li>Refrigerate the stew for up to 4-5 days, or freeze it for up to 2 months. Reheat in the microwave or on a stove top, adding water as needed.</li>&nbsp;
       <li>This is a good meal prep idea, for those who are always on the go.</li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
